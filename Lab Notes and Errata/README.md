# Don't Give Up!
Early on in following the instructions of this book I was tempted to:
1. switch to VMWare Workstation instead of Oracle VirtualBox because of problems I ran into
2. give up (multiple times) because of errors in the provided code and scripts
3. give up (more frustrating each time) because Check Point VMs failed to load or crashed at boot

These problems can all be solved. And definitely stay with VirtualBox. The book itself is solid and obviously a lot
of time and energy was put into it. The step-by step screenshots are exceptionally good. Packt and the author are
working to address the stability issues. Be SURE to check for updates on their GitHub repo, were errata are 
published.

Contact customercare@packetpub.com and mention the book title in the subject of your mesages for assistance, or report
Errata at www.packtpub.com/support/errata and fill in the form.

Errata are laid out separately by chapter in this folder. In a  number of cases, the author graciously provided assistance in identifying where I made mistakes, and how to correct them.
