# Chapter 9

## Returning to the Lab p. 354
1. The book has the wrong login information
    - Page 162 had the user create the account `secadmin` with password `CPL@b8110`, but on page 354 says to log in as `admin` and password `CPL@b8110`
    - Log in as `secadmin` / `CPL@b8110` to continue
2. Check Point VMs are extremely slow to load, and may crash or freeze. Reset (power cycle) and try again, may require more that one reboot.
## Creating a gateway cluster pp. 359-375
1. Screenshot is incorrect
    - the screenshow shows the gateways with a green/checkmark "OK" status; in reality they will be in an error state until the policy is pushed (much) later
