# Don't Give Up!
Early on in following the instructions of this book I was tempted to:
1. switch to VMWare Workstation instead of Oracle VirtualBox because of problems I ran into
2. give up (multiple times) because of errors in the provide codes and scripts

These problems can all be solved. And definitely stay with VirtualBox. The book itself is solid and obviously a lot
of time and energy was put into it. The step-by step screenshots are exceptionaly good. Contact
