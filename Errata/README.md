# Don't Give Up!
Early on in following the instructions of this book I was tempted to:
1. switch to VMWare Workstation instead of Oracle Virtual box because of problems I ran into
2. give up (multiple times) because of errors in the provide codes and scripts

These problems can all be solved. The book itself is solid and obviously a lot of time and energy was put into it.
