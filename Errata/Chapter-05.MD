# Chapter 5

## Check Point VMs have trouble booting
1. In some cases the Check Point VMs will crash at booting; reset (power cycle) the VM and eventually it will boot
2. Very long delays booting Check Point VMs; if there is disk and CPU activity, try letting it run for 15 minutes more
3. Adding more vCPUs doen't always help; 4 vCPUs seems optimal and more than that increases the error messages
4. Multiple resets maybe be required; allow additional time after the console login prompt appears for system services to start
## First Time Configuration Wizard for gateways pp. 167-172
1. The book is missing three steps between steps 3 and 4
    - Device Information (missing this may be intentional as this is later configured on page 186)
        - Host Name: CPCM1
        - Domain Name: mycp.lab
        - Primary DNS Server: 10.20.20.10
    - Date and Time Settings
        - Set the date and time as you do on the SMS on page 159
    - Installation Type
        - Select Security Gateway and/or Security Management and click Next
## First-time configuration using the CLI pp. 172-177
1. Page 174, step 8 has an error in the code and is not entirely clear about the correct values to enter
    - Remember to be in expert mode (see step 4, enter the `expert` command)
    - You must run the command provided in the box to retrieve the correct password hash: `dbget passwd:admin:passwd`
    - When editing the file `CPCM2_FTCW`, put the hash you retrieved in single quotes after `admin_hash`. The box has a typo; there should be no space between the single quotes.
## IPv4 Static Routes pp. 188-191
1. Figure 5.35 shows the default gateway static route before it is configured. Page 167 specifically said not to configure a default gateway. After a section of steps you are NOT supposed to follow, a statement without a step number is made, confusing the user.
    - Follow the instructions "When we click Add Gateway or Edit in this section"; enter the IP address according to Figure 5.37
    - In the IPv4 Static Routes section, click on "Default", then click Edit
    - Click Add Gateway then IP Address
    - IPv4 Address: 200.100.0.254
    - The other settings shown in the book don't work as shown
    - You should now be able to ping 8.8.8.8 from CPCM1
