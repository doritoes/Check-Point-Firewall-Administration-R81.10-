# Testing Still Required
1. Test Windows Server base VM installation GUI build (manual) with the updated `eject_and_snapshot_WINBASE.bat`. In previous testing, found errors, requiring `eject_and_snapshot_WINBASE_GUI.bat`
2. Still need to test the one-liner FTW on page 175
3. Still need to test chapters 13-15
